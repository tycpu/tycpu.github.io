# 🧠 Linux Kernel Series (for ARM64 SoC)

I'm a CPU Software Engineer at **Samsung Electronics (Exynos team)**  
working on Linux kernel internals, particularly **ARM64 architecture, scheduler**, and **CPU frequency drivers**.

This blog documents my technical journey through the Linux kernel.

All content is written in English to improve my global communication skills  
and prepare for future opportunities in international tech environments.

- 🔧 Focus: Linux kernel boot, TF-A, Bootloader, ARM64
- ✍️ Language: English (for technical writing & interviews)
