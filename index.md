# 🧠 Linux Kernel Boot Series (for ARM64 SoC)

I'm a CPU Software Engineer at **Samsung Electronics (Exynos team)**  
working on Linux kernel internals, particularly **ARM64 architecture, scheduler**, and **CPU frequency drivers**.

This blog documents my technical journey through the Linux kernel boot process —  
from the very first power-on reset to the start of the `start_kernel()` function.

All content is written in English to improve my global communication skills  
and prepare for future opportunities in international tech environments.

- 🔧 Focus: Linux kernel boot, TF-A, Bootloader, ARM64
- ✍️ Language: English (for technical writing & interviews)
