## üß± Role of the Boot ROM (BL0)
<div style="margin:20px 0;"></div>

### üöÄ Reset Vector
---

I mentioned before that if the reset pin gets into a high state and the POR exits the reset state,  
<span class="highlight">**the CPU jumps to the reset vector.**</span>  
<span class="highlight">**The reset vector has the starting address of BOOTROM.**</span>

### üß† Assembly and ROM Characteristics
---
BOOTROM is a code that is **hard-coded with assembly** and is read-only.  
This code is custom-made for vendors like Samsung and Qualcomm.

The reason why this code is written in assembly is  
because at this time, there is no MMU (used for virtual addressing), no cache, and no stack.  
So the developer **can't write BOOTROM code using virtual addresses or assume register initialization.**

### üß≠ Memory and Execution Environment
---

Additionally, BOOTROM is mapped to a limited ROM area.  
And in some cases, a small amount of **SRAM is used during execution BOOTROM code.**  
This is due to booting speed and security reasons.  
If this code is too heavy during execution,  
booting becomes slower and the system becomes more exposed to potential security attacks.

## üéØ Why BOOTROM is Necessary
---

This code is not only the starting point of booting.
<div style="margin:20px 0;"></div>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Always Executable

First, I said that this code is the starting point of booting.  
But we have to focus on the word "starting".  
**If this point can't start, the SoC cannot operate at all.**  
So this code is always mandatory and must be executed no matter what.
<div style="margin:20px 0;"></div>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Secure by Design

Second, if this code is hacked, the SoC also cannot be operated.  
So security is extremely important for BOOTROM code.  
Fortunately, this code is stored in <span class="highlight">**immutable ROM**, meaning **it cannot be modified after manufacturing SoC.**</span>  

Also, BOOTROM code **verifies the digital signature of all bootloader steps.**  
BOOTROM has the vendor‚Äôs public key embedded in advance, and it uses it to verify the authenticity of bootloader steps(Secure BOOT).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Entry Point for Next Bootloader Step (BL1)

Third, the CPU needs an entry point for the next bootloader step.  
BOOTROM determines the next stage(BL1) and transfers execution to it.  

This is possible with a **boot mode pin.**  
The boot mode pin is a kind of hardware, like a signal switch.  
<span class="highlight">The boot mode pin tells BOOTROM **where to load the bootloader step from**</span> - like eMMC, USB, or UART.  

<div style="background:#f0f8ff; border-left:4px solid #007acc; padding:10px; margin:15px 0;">
üí° <strong>Note:</strong> Additionally, BOOTROM performs some initial tasks like SRAM initialization and watchdog disable.<br>
After that, <strong>other bootloader steps can be executed in a more advanced environment(DRAM and C language).</strong>
