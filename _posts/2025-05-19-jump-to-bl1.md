## 🚀 Jump to TF-A (BL1)

The next bootloader, called **BL1**, needs to be executed.   
BOOTROM is responsible for loading this bootloader before executing it.

---

### 🔧 How does BOOTROM know where to load BL1 from?

The boot source is determined by hardware option values like:

- **boot mode pin**
- **fuse**
- **OTP**

These are set by each vendor during board or SoC design.  
For example, the boot mode pin indicates like (the location from which BOOTROM gets BL1):

```
00 → eMMC booting  
01 → SPI NOR booting  
10 → USB booting (for debugging)
```

---

### 📥 Where is BL1 loaded?

BL1 is loaded into **SRAM**.

The reason for this is that the main memory (DRAM) is not initialized yet.  
DRAM initialization happens later in **BL2**.  
Since SRAM consumes less power and is directly accessible early in the boot process, it's used for BL1.

Typical memory layout:

```
SRAM address:           0x0004_0000 ~ 0x0004_FFFF  
BL1 loading address:    0x0004_0000
```

So, BOOTROM reads BL1 binary from the selected boot source (eMMC or SPI)  
and copies it into the SRAM address. Then it jumps to that address to execute BL1.

---

### 🚪 How does BOOTROM find the entry point of BL1?

There are two main methods:

#### ✅ 1. Fixed Entry Address

A simple method: the entry address is fixed in hardware design.

```
BL1 Entry Address = 0x00040000
```

BOOTROM just copies the image and jumps to that address directly.

---

#### ✅ 2. Image Header

Another method is using a metadata header embedded in the image:

```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t magic;         // Magic number for validation
    uint32_t entry_point;   // <-- This is key
    uint32_t image_size;
    uint32_t checksum;
} bl1_header_t;
```

BOOTROM reads this header, parses the `entry_point` field, and jumps to it.

In many platforms, both methods are used together:
- Fixed loading address (e.g., `0x40000`)
- Dynamic entry point (e.g., `0x40080` from header)

---

### 🏁 How does BOOTROM jump to BL1?

Once the entry point is determined, BOOTROM sets it into a general-purpose register(e.g., x0..)    
and uses a branch instruction to jump:

```asm
ldr     x0, =0x00040000  
br      x0
```

At this point, CPU begins executing BL1’s first instruction.

---

### 🔐 Secure Boot Consideration

If Secure Boot is enabled, BOOTROM will:

- **Verify the digital signature** of BL1 binary
- If the signature is invalid, BOOTROM halts(or retries from another media depending on platform configuration).

---

### 🔄 BL1 loading Flow Summary

1. BOOTROM gets power and runs  
2. Reads setting for loading BL1 from pin/fuse  
3. Loads BL1 from selected storage (eMMC, SPI, USB, etc.)  
4. Copies BL1 image into SRAM  
5. Gets BL1 entry point (fixed or via header)  
6. Branches to entry point  
7. Now, **BL1 is running**
