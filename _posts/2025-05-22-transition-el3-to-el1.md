## 🔁 Transition from EL3 to EL2/EL1

### 🧭 The last role of EL3: When, and why this layer is transferred

EL3 is really important for security and stable initialization.  
But it doesn't provide general execution environment like OS and hypervisor.  
So, we have to know about the role of each exception layer.

| Exception Level | Role |
|------------------|------|
| EL3 | Make up security with TrustZone and initialize |
| EL1 / EL2 | Execute OS like Linux |

EL3 gives control to EL1 or EL2(depending on platform configuration) when the following conditions are met:

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | SoC is initialized stably → can use DRAM, MMU, cache |
| 2 | Secure / Non-secure world are divided → GIC, MMU setting completed |
| 3 | OS / Bootloader is ready to execute → BL33 loaded |
| 4 | Registers like `SPSR_EL3`, `ELR_EL3` are ready |

---

## 🔧 The minimal setting for transition

When EL3 has to give control to EL1 or EL2,  
three registers must be set(SP for target EL should also be prepared.):

| Register | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SCR_EL3` | Secure → Non-secure state, instruction set |
| `SPSR_EL3` | Next EL’s CPU mode, interrupt state, stack pointer behavior |
| `ELR_EL3` | Target address for control transfer |

### 🔹 SCR_EL3 major fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| NS | Set to 1 to switch to Non-secure World |
| RW | Set to 1 to use AArch64 (0 = AArch32) |

### 🔹 SPSR_EL3 major fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| M[3:0] | Mode (e.g. `0b0101 = EL1h`, `0b0100 = EL1t`, `0b1001 = EL2h`) |
|        | → Determines Exception Level and SP selection |
| D/A/I/F | Debug, SError, IRQ, FIQ disable flags (1 = disable) |
| SP | Selects SP_ELx or SP_EL0 (based on mode) |

---

## 🚀 ERET: Not just a return

`ERET` is not just an instruction for PC return.  
It is an instruction for transitioning between Exception Levels and restoring context with set registers.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Jump to address in `ELR_EL3` |
| 2 | Restore CPU state from `SPSR_EL3` |
| 3 | Switch to AArch64 (if `SCR_EL3.RW = 1`) |
| 4 | Enter Non-secure World (if `SCR_EL3.NS = 1`) |

### 💡 Example code
```asm
MOV X0, #(1 << 0 | 1 << 10) // NS=1, RW=1 (Non-secure, AArch64)
MSR SCR_EL3, X0

MOV X1, #(0b1001 | (0b1111 << 6)) // EL2h, all interrupts masked
MSR SPSR_EL3, X1

LDR X2, =0x80080000 // EL2 entry point
MSR ELR_EL3, X2

ERET // Transition!
```

### ❗️ Transition considerations

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Incorrect SCR_EL3 or SPSR_EL3 setting → transition fails |
| 2 | Secure resource config must be complete before transition |
| 3 | Memory/cache must be set up properly (e.g. MMU state) |

---

## 🔐 Security: Secure → Non-secure

| Concept | Secure World | Non-secure World |
|---------|--------------|------------------|
| Access to secure DRAM | ✅ 가능 | ❌ 불가 |
| Access to secure interrupt | ✅ 가능 | ❌ 불가 |
| Access to TEE, cryptographic key | ✅ 가능 | ❌ 불가 |

### ✅ Protection mechanisms

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Memory Protection (TZASC) | Define secure DRAM area, cause fault on unauthorized access |
| Interrupt Protection (GIC) | Route secure/non-secure interrupts separately |
| Peripheral Access Control (TZPC) | Assign access policy to devices (e.g. UART0 secure only) |

---

### 🔄 Returning to Secure World

Returning is only possible using `SMC` (Secure Monitor Call):

- Called from Non-secure EL1/EL2
- Traps to EL3 (Secure Monitor handler)
- Handler checks and processes request securely

---

## 📦 Code-based flow (TF-A: `bl31`)

### 🔹 1) Transition entry: `bl31_main()`

```c
void bl31_main(void)
{
    ...
    cm_prepare_el3_exit(NON_SECURE);
    ...
    el3_exit();
}
```

### 🔹 2) Register setup: cm_prepare_el3_exit()
```c
void cm_prepare_el3_exit(uint32_t security_state)
{
    ...
    write_scr_el3(scr_val);
    cm_set_next_eret_context(security_state);
    cm_set_elr_el3(security_state, entry_point);
    ...
}
```
### 🔹 3) Final transition: el3_exit in assembly
```asm
el3_exit:
    ldr x0, =cm_get_context(NON_SECURE)
    bl  restore_el3_sysregs   // Restore system registers
    bl  cm_exit_context       // Final context handling
    eret                      // Transition to EL1 or EL2
```

### ✅ Final summary flow
```text
bl31_main()
 └─ cm_prepare_el3_exit()       // Register setting
 └─ el3_exit()                  // Restore context → ERET
       └─ eret                  // EL3 → EL1 or EL2
```
