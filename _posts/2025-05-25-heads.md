## 🧠 Entering the Linux Kernel: `head.S`

---

### 1️⃣ Preperation Before Executing `head.S` (`_start`)

`head.S` is the starting point since bootloader jumps to linux kernel and executes it.  
The simple flow of kernel executing it like this:

```nginx
  _start
   └──> __create_page_tables      # create initial page table
   └──> __enable_mmu              # MMU(memory management unit) activate
   └──> __primary_switched        # enter to virtual address
   └──> start_kernel()            # enter to C code
```
Let me explain each step:

---

#### 🔹 `_start`: the first entry point of kernel

- bootloader sends this address to kernel for entry point  
- it is executed on physical address, and the MMU is off  
- cache and MMU are off. and kernel can't use virtual address and stack. (hardware initial state)

---

#### 🔹 `__create_page_tables`: make initial page table

- make page table for mapping physical addresses to virtual addresses (1:1 mapping)  
- after turning on MMU, kernel is operated on virtual address

---

#### 🔹 `__enable_mmu`: turn on MMU

- since mmu is turned on, accessing to address is changed from physical to virtual  
- caches are also activated at this time  
- all codes of kernel is operated on linking virtual addresses

---

#### 🔹 Init `.bss` and Set Up Stack

- `.bss` is the section that global variables with no value are located  
- after booting, global variables must be initialized to 0  
- and then setting up stack, it is ready to enter to C code

---

#### 🔹 `__primary_switched`: ready to enter to C code

- previous step to jump to `start_kernel()`  
- operating C code on virtual address


### 2️⃣ First Enter Point of ARM64 Linux Kernel
The path of head.S is:
```text
    path: arch/arm64/kernel/head.S
```
This file is wrote by assembly and the first run of Linux Kernel.  
In fact, if bootloader jumps to starting point of kernel,  
it is started from `_start` label which is included in `head.S`.  
And the other labels (`__enable_mmu`, etc..) that I mentioned before chapter are also included in `head.S`.

The reason why `head.S` is wrote by assembly is because  
before initialize MMU, there is no virtual addresses so it needs to control on low-level.

---

If `head.S` execution reaches to end point,  
it jumps to `start_kernel` with `bl` instruction.  
After that, virtual address + kernel init code with C language is executed (`start_kernel()`).

---

✅ `start_kernel()` is the end point of booting sequence,  
and the entry point of Linux Kernel internal initialization.
