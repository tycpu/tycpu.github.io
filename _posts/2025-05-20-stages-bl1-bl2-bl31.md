## 🛡️ TF-A: Secure World Initialization  
### 🔹 Stages: BL1 → BL2 → BL31

TF-A is the public framework from ARM that is used for **secure boot**.  
It initializes SoC and divides Secure World and Non-Secure World on SoC.

We studied until BL1 in the last post, and BL1 is the starting point of TF-A.  
The step of TF-A is like that:  
**BL1 → BL2 → BL31**

So, I want to study about three topics at this session.  
First is about the role of each BL.  
Second is the reason why booting sequence is operated like this flow.  
And third is the images and elements that each stages load.

***

## 1️⃣ The Role of Each BL

- **BL1** exists for minimal init and BL2 loader.  
  It is located in SRAM and loads BL2.

- **BL2** exists for DRAM init.  
  (BL2 is excuted from SRAM and initializes DRAM.)  
  At previous process, SoC can't use DRAM.  
  But BL2 initializes DRAM controller, so DRAM can be used after BL2.  
  And BL2 also loads some images like BL31, U-BOOT and OP-TEE.

- **BL31** is for secure monitor and EL transition.  
  And because of BL2, BL31 can be located in DRAM(it can also be located in SRAM for execution).  
  BL31 is run at Exception level3.  
  So BL31 initializes EL3 and makes secure world like trustzone.  
  And also BL31 handles PSCI(CPU power interface) and SMC call.  
  After BL31, it jumps to EL1 or EL2.

## 2️⃣ Why Booting Sequence is Operated Like This Flow

BL1 is operated in SRAM.  
And for initializing DRAM, it jumps to BL2.  
The reason why it has to initialize DRAM is for using EL3 code.  
EL3 code is operated in DRAM because of its size(EL3 code needs huge memory for loading).  
And after this step, CPU can jump to EL1/EL2.  
Linux can be operated on EL1/EL2.  
So this sequence is really reasonable.  
This sequence is called **"Dependency boot chain"**.

## 3️⃣ Images and Elements That Each Stage Loads

| Stage | Loaded Image         | Source            | Load Target      | Purpose             |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| BL1   | `bl2.bin`            | eMMC / SPI NOR    | SRAM or DRAM     | BL2 execution       |
| BL2   | `bl31.bin`           | eMMC / SPI NOR    | DRAM (EL3)       | Secure monitor      |
|       | `bl33.bin` (U-Boot)  | eMMC / SPI NOR    | DRAM (Non-secure)| Kernel loader       |
|       | `bl32.bin` (OP-TEE)  | eMMC / SPI NOR    | DRAM (Secure)    | Trusted OS          |
|       | Device Tree (`.dtb`) | eMMC / SPI NOR    | DRAM             | Hardware information|

> BL31 doesn't load any images itself.  
> It just operates with some images which are loaded on BL2.
> Device Tree is typically loaded by BL2. Not mandatory.
